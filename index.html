			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello World! Just kidding. I'm about as tired seeing that phrase as I am writing it. Seriously though welcome to my online portfolio. 
				If you can't already tell my personality is about as colorful as this site. I'm from Houston, Texas which is where I currently live. 
				I have 3 children who take up a lot of my time but when I'm not laying the Smack Down on them I enjoy going to art shows, cooking or 
				just plain nerding out on documentaries. I love to learn new things!
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now I am working in the oil and gas industry as a mechanical designer creating downhole tools but I am looking to make a career change into web development.
				I love working with people on projects and I'm not afraid of a challenge. I have gone through numerous online tutorials and online courses including Udacity's 
				Grow With Google Front End Web Development program. Two of my favorite developers that I follow and have taken online courses from are Wes Bos and Brad Traversy.

						<h3>The Adventures of Little Tikka</h3>
						<p> 
							This is one of the first projects that I created because I saw a website that used parallax scrolling to tell a beautiful story 
							<a href="http://jessandruss.us/" target="_blank">Jess and Russ</a> and it really inspired me. So I created my own version to tell the 
							story of my youngest son who goes by the nickname "Tikka". Think Look Who's Talking meets James Bond. This is a work in progress that I 
							try and add to whenever I have spare time. <br>
							Since this is a parallax site it does not work on mobile.

						<h3>Houston Art Crawl</h3>
						<p>
							This is a redesign of an existing website <a href="http://www.artcrawlhouston.com/" target="_blank">Houston Art Crawl</a> that I started 
							because when I went on their website originally to find out information about the event I was completely shocked at the site that they were 
							using. I wanted to do something modern and I used Materialize and jQuery.

						<h3>Memory Game</h3>
						<p>
							I created a memory game that was part of the curriculum at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001" 
							target="_blank">Udacity</a>. I used vanilla Javascript. My youngest son loves playing this game which is pretty cool. I plan on having 
							different levels and creating different cards to match (words) and add in audio for each card to help him increase his vocabulary.

						<h3>US Timezones</h3>
						<p>
							I originally saw this tutorial as part of Wes Bos's <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">Javascript 30</a> course and thought 
							why show one clock when you can show 4? So I created a timezone site that shows you the timezones in the United States no matter what time 
							zone the user is in. I used vanilla Javascript as well as the Moment library.

						<h3>Restaurant Picker</h3>
						<p>
							At my job my co-workers and I are the most indecisive group of people when it comes to choosing a place to eat at lunch so 
							I decided to create this simple Python program so that we could choose a random restaurant to eat at. There is no GUI but you can 
							view, randomize, add or delete a restaurant.
